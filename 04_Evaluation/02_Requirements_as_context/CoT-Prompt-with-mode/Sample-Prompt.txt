Below are artifacts from the same software system. Is there a traceability link between (a) and (b)?
Consider that the numbered TARGET requirement also exist in the same software system.
Give your reasoning, then answer with 'yes' or 'no' enclosed in <trace></trace>.

(a) requirement: ```Coordinate system conversion

When requested  the _CoordinateSystem_ shall transform coordinates to alternate formats.```
(b) requirement: ```Coordinate system conversion from p-vector

When requested  coordinates shall be transformed from p-vectors to the default representation.```

Context:
(1): ```Coordinate system conversion to n-vector

When requested  the _CoordinateSystem_ shall transform coordinates transformed from the default representation to n-vectors.```
(2): ```Coordinate system conversion to p-vector

When requested  the _CoordinateSystem_ shall be transform coordinates from the default representation to p-vectors.```
(3): ```Coordinate system conversion from n-vector

When requested  coordinates shall be transformed from n-vectors to the default representation.```
(4): ```Default coordinate system

The default coordinate representation shall use LLA (longitude  latitude  altitude) format.```
(5): ```Forward commands to UAV

The _GCS_ shall transform commands into a vehicle specific format.```
